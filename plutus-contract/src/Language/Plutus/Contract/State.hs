{- Note [Handling state in contracts]

If we look at 'runContract' in 'Language.Plutus.Contract.Contract', we can see
that it takes a list of events and runs the contract as far as possible, until
either the events are depleted or the contract is done. That means we can take
the current state of the contract to be represented by the type '[Event]'. When
a new event comes in, we add it to the previous state, and apply 'runContract' 
again.

This is nice because '[Event]' is a type we can serialise (which we 
would like to do because our contract should expose a stateless interface to 
the outside world, and so we need to be able to recover the state from its 
serialised form), and at the same time we can write our contracts using the full
power of the 'ContractPrompt' interface, ie. monad, applicative, etc. In 
addition, by restricting the contract's effects to what comes down to different 
forms of `Prompt`, we get completely deterministic execution of contracts.

There is a drawback however. The list-of-events representation of the state 
means we have to replay all previous events whenever we want to process a new 
event, so 'runContract' uses time proportional to the number of events that 
have been seen.

Can we do better than '[Event]' without compromising on the expressiveness of 
the 'Contract' interface? It turns out we can, by pruning the event sequence 
whenever the contract has arrived at a state that we know how to serialise to 
something better than '[Event]'. This is the purpose of the 'StatefulContract' 
type and the functions in this module, and the 'Record' type in 
'Language.Plutus.Contract.Record'.

The main problem with serialising the contract state to anything other than '
[Event]' is that the state may contain arbitrary callbacks introduced by 
the 'Control.Monad.PromptT' type. The only time we can be certain that a 
contract has no callbacks that it is waiting for is when 'runContract' (with 'f 
= Maybe') evaluates to 'Just a'. At that point, the 'a' represents exactly the 
same state as the list of events, '[Event]', that was used to produce the 'a'. 
So if we want to serialise the state now, we can just serialise the 'a' and 
drop all the events.

This is complicated by the fact that contracts may have multiple branches that 
run at the same time (using '<*>') or one after another (with '>>='). So for a
contract 'l <*> r', if the 'r' branch is done but the 'l' branch is still 
waiting for input, we can only drop the events that have been seen by 'r', and 
we must continue to use the '[Event]' representation for the state of 'l' until 
both 'l' and 'r' are finished. 

To account for this, we store the events in a 
'Language.Plutus.Contract.Record.Record' instead of a list. The record is a 
tree that mirrors the structure of the contract, and whenever one of the 
contract's branches is done we can serialise its state and store it in the 
correct location in the record.

Finally we need to know how to serialise the result value of the (branch of a) contract when it's done. This is what the 'StatefulContract' type is for. We can
use its 'CJSONCheckpoint' constructor to inject the serialisation constraints at
arbitrary points in the contract. So we could write the previous example as
'l <*> jsonCheckpoint r' to ensure that the events consumed by the 'r' branch
are discarded as soon as 'r' produces a result.

To actually run a 'StatefulContract', we need to
* use 'initialise' to get the initial state (of type 'Record') of the contract
* for each new event, run 'insertAndUpdate' with the current state and the event
  to get the new state. 

TODO: There is a lot of boilerplate in the definitions of 'runClosed' and 
'runOpen' - the cases we have to cover are all possible combinations of the
constructors of 'StatefulContract' and 'Record'. 

I did attempt to reduce this by using 'newtype Rec i a = Rec Either (OpenRecord i) (ClosedRecord i, a)' and variations but always ran into trouble. I would be 
very grateful for suggestions on how to improve this situation.
